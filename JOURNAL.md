## 10/8/2025 - Started voice card design  

First step - Voice card design.

After a bunch of research and being mainly inspired by the [Polykit-X voice card](https://github.com/polykit/polykit-x-voice-card), I've decided to have the following functions:
<br>
- A VCO with saw, triangle, and pulse wave outputs
- VCAs for blending, envelope and panning
- ADSR envelope
- A velocity controlled parameter (customisable)
- Hard and Soft VCO sync
- Wavefolder
- State-variable filter (blended LP/BP/HP)
- Low Frequency Oscillator
- Stereo output

Now to actually implement it...

I particularly liked the modularity of the voice cards' connection to the main board, see the [creator's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@polykit) for more detail.
I plan to use a similar connection.

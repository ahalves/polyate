This is my journal of the design and building process of **polyate**.

## 10/5/2025 - Started analog voice card design and assigned a pinout  

## First step - Voice card design.

After a bunch of research, I've got this:

### Main ICs and their uses:
**AS3340** - Voltage Controlled Oscillator (**VCO**) 

**AS3310** - Attack Decay Sustain Release Envelope (**ADSR**)

**LM13700** - Voltage Controlled Amplifier (**VCA**), Filter, Wavefolder

**CD4016** - For waveform switching

**TL074** - For buffering, summing, scaling (if needed)

### Voice Card Pinout:

I drafted a table for the pinout and what each pin will do:

| Pin |  Label  | Voltage/V |    Function   | Description |
|-----|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|1	  |PITCH_CV	|0-5		|Pitch CV		|Controls VCO frequency|
|2	  |GATE		|0/5		|Gate			|Triggers ADSR envelope (high = on, low = off)|
|3	  |VEL_CV	|0-5		|Velocity CV	|Controls a parameter based on velocity (to be decided)|
|4	  |FM_CV	|0-5		|FM CV			|Modulates VCO frequency|
|5	  |PWM_CV	|0-5		|PWM CV			|Controls VCO pulse wave width|
|6	  |SYNC_IN	|0/5		|Sync In		|Pulse for VCO syncing to modify timbre|
|7	  |FOLD_CV	|0-5		|Wavefold CV	|Controls wavefolder depth|
|8	  |CUT_CV	|0-5		|Cutoff CV		|Controls state-variable filter cutoff frequency|
|9	  |RES_CV	|0-5		|Resonance CV	|Controls filter resonance (Q)|
|10	  |MORPH_CV	|0-5		|Morph CV		|Blends filter outputs (continuous LP<->BP<->HP)|
|11	  |PAN_CV	|-2 to +2	|Pan CV			|Controls stereo panning|
|12	  |SAW_SEL	|0/5		|Wave Select 1	|Enables saw wave output|
|13	  |TRI_SEL	|0/5		|Wave Select 2	|Enables triangle wave output|
|14	  |PUL_SEL	|0/5		|Wave Select 3	|Enables pulse wave output|
|15	  |AUDIO_L	|-5 to +5	|Audio Out Left	|Stereo left channel output|
|16	  |AUDIO_R	|-5 to +5	|Audio Out Right|Stereo right channel output|
|17	  |+12V		|12			|+12V Power		|Positive analog IC power|
|18	  |-12V		|-12		|-12V Power		|Negative analog IC power|
|19	  |+5V		|5			|+5V Power		|Logic power|
|20	  |GND		|0			|Ground			|System ground|

This took a while...

Next up - designing the schematic.
